Easy 3 miler at lunchtime with Anna and Anthea so should be feeling good, but I’ve been suffering most of the day (Piriformis).  
Strangely seems worse on easy days.

Anyway need to push through it – longer day planned for tomorrow, somewhere around 8 to 12 miles.

New song for the running playlist – Dig in (Lenny Kravits).

Also starting to plan races and full day runs for next year. More on that when I’m closer to finalising it.

That’s all today…
