Well I finally feel as though I’m getting back to it…

I’m running for 5 or 6 days per week, covering around 30 miles with individual run being 3 – 12 miles. I also seem to be finding a bit of speed which is giving me the feeling of progress.

Still tough knowing that I have run X minutes per mile faster, or a particular route faster by X minutes – it’ll get there though.

![](assets/images/l1331090213.jpg)Recovery seems to be taking longer also – maybe that is just a factor of trying to build distance/endurance again (or a factor of being old…)

I’m starting to realise that [Runkeeper](http://runkeeper.com) is causing me to push myself a bit harder than I should be. The problem is, with the Runkeeper Lady announcing my distance, time and average pace every half mile, that no matter what my average pace is, I try to get it down to the next 15 second block – so if it’s 8:12 I’ll speed up to try and get it under 8:00, if it’s 7:55 I’ll try and get it under 7:45 etc. This is good for days when I am doing harder runs, but not great on days when I’m just out for a recovery run. I’m a \*little\* too competitive I guess.

Now I just need to get the weekly distance back to the 50 mile mark for a few weeks before starting to push on with long, long runs…
