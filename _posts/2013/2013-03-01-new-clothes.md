[![image](assets/images/image_thumb.png "image")](assets/images/image.png)Just bought myself a couple of new running bits in preparation for the Thames Path 100.

I bought a Montane Minimus WP Jacket from [SportsShoes.com](http://www.sportsshoes.com) (£111.99) and I bought a pair of Race Ready Active V-Notch Shorts from the [ULTRAmarathonRunningStore](http://www.ultramarathonrunningstore.com/default.asp) (on the recommendation from [James Adams](http://www.runningandstuff.com/blog/2013/1/26/race-ready-shorts-review.html)) for £32.99 – much more than I’d normally pay for shorts, or a running jacket but they do sound pretty good.[![image](assets/images/image_thumb1.png "image")](assets/images/image1.png)

I’ll do a review of each when I’ve had a chance to play with them.
