Double run today.  
Had hoped to get a long run in during my commute but couldnâ€™t drag my lazy arse out of bed.

Ran a fast 5.7m at lunchtime, including a hard effort up Norcot Hill (only 2 seconds off my PB for that section) in strong blustery winds, so quite pleased with that!  
I really needed 8-12 miles for the day though, so I headed out again at 9.30pm and cranked out an easy 3 and a bit miles, giving me almost 9 for the day.

Also got a text today telling me thereâ€™s no footy training for Alastair on Saturday, so Iâ€™m now planned to have a rest day tomorrow and a hard effort at Newbury Parkrun on Saturday. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™m in sub 20 shape but maybe around 21.30.

Overall, happy with my training at the moment ðŸ™‚
