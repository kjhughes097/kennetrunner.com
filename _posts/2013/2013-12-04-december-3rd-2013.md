Really getting back into it! Got up this morning feeling strong and that gliding sensation as you walk around feeling 20 feet tall.

Yesterday was a rest day after a late 11.4 miler (9min pace) on Sunday, but I did do a few sets of press ups – trying to get some core work done on easy and rest days. So no surprise I felt strong this morning.

Today I doubled up on runs. And easy 5k at lunchtime with Anthea and then a hard 6 miler late evening (7.50 pace).  
Looking at going easy tomorrow and then longish (8 – 12m) on Thursday
