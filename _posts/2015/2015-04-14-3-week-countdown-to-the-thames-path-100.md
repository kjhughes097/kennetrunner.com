Now into the last 3 weeks before the [Thames Path 100](http://www.centurionrunning.com/thames-path-100-2015/thames-path-100-2015/). I had planned on starting to gradually taper from this point, but I seem to have been blighted by some man-flu virus that has left me shivery, achy and with a head full of snot. I have my lovely wife to thank for this, she caught it a few days before me and kindly passed it on.

Last run was on Saturday, a quick [4 miler](https://www.strava.com/activities/283361407) as I was pressed for time, then Sundays planned 8 miler seemed to disappear from under me as time ran out while I was balancing a couple of hyper kids (at Butlins) and a poorly wife stuck in the hotel room.

Anyway, Monday was bad, but I managed to get some bed time in the afternoon and evening, then today (Tuesday) I’m feeling marginally better – I’m hoping I can have it beaten in another day or two, and get a final long (16 miler) run at the weekend (that will be 2 weeks to go), before cutting back a bit further.

Also, a bit of a panic today as I got an email from [Centurion](http://centurionrunning.com) telling me I did not have the entry qualification. A frantic check of what I submitted in my entry form, and substituting it from something more appropriate (i.e. in line with the entry criteria) save that all resolved.

I also took some time today to put together my race card – this is something that I definitely find useful – I do a little Excel spreadsheet of the Aid Stations, what distance they are at, what the likely 24hr time is and what the cut-off time is – I think print this at around business card size and laminate it with ‘instant self laminating cards’ from Staples – it gives me a waterproof/dirtproof card that weighs next to nothing that I can keep handy and mentally check off as I reach aid stations. For this years card I also included my times from the Thames Path 100 in 2013 ([DNF at 76 miles](https://kennetrunner.com/thames-path-100-race-report "Thames Path 100 – Race Report")) as another reference point
