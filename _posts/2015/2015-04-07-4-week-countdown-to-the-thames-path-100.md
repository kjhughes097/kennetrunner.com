Well, we’re into the last 4 weeks of the countdown to the Thames Path 100 mile race (2015 edition).

Everything was going well in training until a [little Achilles problem](https://kennetrunner.com/10-weeks-of-great-training-then-injury "10 Weeks of Great Ultra Marathon Training then Injury") that took me out for around 3 or 4 weeks. Thankfully that seems to be over now – I have been trying to ramp back up ***sensibly*** over the past couple of weeks, and not overdo things (which is unusual for me).

This past week has seen me get back up to 50+ miles, and get a couple of back to back long runs in. The two big testers that I wanted to get through – a morning [Tesco Loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/278304850 "Tesco Loop") with the guys, and a [long (18+ mile) canal run](https://www.strava.com/activities/279470790 "long canal run") – both went okay.

I’ve got a final big day planned, hopefully tomorrow, where I’ll run commute to work in the morning, and then home again in the evening (totaling around 35 miles) – this is to make up for not having a done a decent long effort in this years build up (was planned around 3 weeks ago).  
Providing this goes okay, I should be heading into the taper with high confidence.

This year is the year I get this monkey off my back.
