It’s important to start kids out in the right way early on. The more encouragement and enjoyment they get the better.

This is Ruby at age 8 doing her first [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/ "rubys first parkrun"). She loved it, even though she got a blister and came second to last (guess who was last…)  
Can’t wait till she’s old enough to come on a long training run with me.
