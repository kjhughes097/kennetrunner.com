A few times each week, I go for a lunchtime run from work in Reading. This is usually down a lane to the path next to the River Thames and then an out and back from there (usual north towards Pangbourne). On a Friday morning, before work, I sometimes head south down the Thames to Sonning Bridge. I’ve also run Marlow to Reading, Reading to Streatley and a number of other routes along the Thames. The [Thames Path 100](http://www.centurionrunning.com/thames-path-100-2015/ "thames path 100 ultra") ultra is something I’ve been wrestling with for 3 years now.

Suffice to say that the River Thames plays a big part in my training.

So, I was pleased to see [Paul Ali](http://ultraavon.com "ultra avon / paul ali") announce the Thames Trail Marathon (series) – two new events that he has planned on the river. Paul is a prolific ultramarathoner and is pretty active running around these areas also, working just up the road, and I pass him by the river at lunchtime every  week or two.

Check out [saturdaynighmarathon.com](http://saturdaynightmarathon.com/ "saturday night marathon") – The Thames Trail Marathon runs on two dates (25th July and 19th September), and on each date there’s a Marathon and a Half Marathon – loops of the local routes on the Thames. I promptly entered both events, marathon distance.

It’s a lovely setting, and the route is laps of an out and back 6ish miler, so there’ll be plenty of opportunity to see the other runners (and an aid station every 3ish miles). It starts at 5pm, so promises a beautiful summers evening of running.
