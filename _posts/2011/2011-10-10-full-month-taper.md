Since that day I have done only a handful of runs, totalling less than 15 miles rather than the 84 miles I had planned. Not Good.

There are now 2 weeks to go (13 days actually) until race day and I will have done nothing long in the final month.

I have started doing a few short runs on it in the past 3 or 4 days, and with any luck I will get a 8-12 miler in at the weekend – need something to give me a bit of a confidence boost.

Actually, I am really looking forward to the race, even with the blip in training – with any luck my base and previous training will see me through well.

On a positive note, I have raised over £350 so far – feel free to add to it [www.justgiving.com/kjhughes](http://www.justgiving.com/kjhughes)
