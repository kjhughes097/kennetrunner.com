This week I had some good structure to my training. Having created the plan at the start of the week, I was making good progress following it.

The [mid week long run went really well](https://kennetrunner.com/2011/nailed-this-weeks-long-run), in fact it probably went too well in hindsight. It was fast, a new PB for that route / distance and although I had a good rest day afterwards, I think I have overdone things. Friday and Saturday I got out as planned but the soles of my feet were really painful – overuse injury I think.

I decided to listen to my body and take Sunday as a rest day. I was actually looking forward to the hill session (yes, I know…), so i’ll try to schedule that in for another day.

Here’s how this weeks plan and the actual looked….

\[runlog plan=”3S,8S,20E,R,5S,5S,8H,49″ actual=”2.8S,7.8S,18.3T,R,5.7S,5.2S,R,39.8″\]
