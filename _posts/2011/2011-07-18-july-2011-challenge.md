My challenge for July and August (half of which I will be on holiday for) is two 19 mile runs home.

After work, run from the office, along the canal, to home; a short stint along the canal the next morning to catch the train into work and then do the 19 mile run home again after work.

[Here’s the route from work to home](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/37845732), from the last time I did it.

This is a little trial run for the [Druid’s Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events_druidchallenge2011.htm), a 82 miles over 3 days event in September.
