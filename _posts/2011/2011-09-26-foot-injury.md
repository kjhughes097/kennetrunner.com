![Forefoot pain illustration, courtesy of Foot.com](medic009.jpg)I think – no, I know – I have a foot injury.

I have a painful ache / throbbing sensation on the sole of my foot right on the ball. It’s not just one toe, but seems to be across all of them. I think it is also across both feet.

From a bit of research it would seem to be [Metatarsalgia.](http://www.sportsinjurybulletin.com/archive/metatarsalgia.html) I am guessing this came as a result of pushing myself on my mid week long run. I felt okay it come on a little on my Friday run (after a rest day on Thursday, after the Wednesday long run).  
I ran again on Saturday and that seems to have aggravated it – I had pain across my whole sole for the last mile or so.

I’ve not done anything since, but it is still painful / burning…

It reckons an ‘unusually long run’ or a ‘significant increase in training volume’ can cause it, as can ‘poorly designed or worn out shoes’ – I’ve done that same long run a number of times in recent weeks, but this last one was pretty hard/fast, also my shoes are getting a bit worn, and I had worn some other trail shoes on Friday that I haven’t worn in a while – probably a combination of all these things.

Regardless of the cause – it doesn’t bode well for my first Ultra in just over 3 weeks. It won’t stop me doing it, but I guess I’ll have to back off training for a week or so, and should probably get a new pair of shoes.
