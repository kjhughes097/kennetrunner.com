So, it’s official, I have entered my first ultra – the [50K Bimblers Bluff Trail Race](http://mrbimble.com/WordPress/bluff/) in Connecticut, United States.[![trail-running1](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/trail-running1_thumb.jpg "trail-running1")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/trail-running1.jpg)

I’m not to concerned about the distance, but am a little concerned about the terrain – both how muddy / slippery it will be underfoot and the elevation profile (i.e. the hills !!).

Here’s the elevation profile of the first half : [http://www.everytrail.com/view\_trip.php?trip\_id=69264](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=69264)

Most of my training has been along the canal, which by it very nature is relatively flat, but I’m hoping that prior Mountain Marathon and munro bagging experience will see me in good stead. I’ve also been getting in good long runs 17 – 20 milers.  
From today it is 5 weeks out and I have put together a focussed training plan for these last few weeks, I am also breaking in a new pair of Salomon Crossmax trail shoes – causing me blisters at the moment, hope I get them well broken in before the big day !!

Anyway, as part of the race I’m trying to raise some money for charity (Help for Heroes). In just the last couple of days since I told people at work I have just shy of £200 (what a great bunch C2C are !!), if you’d like to help my collect for this very deserving cause then you can donate on my [justgiving](http://www.justgiving.com/kjhughes) page – or read more details on my [Charity](https://kennetrunner.com/charity) page.

Watch out for the race report in a few weeks…
