This past week / weekend has been my highest volume / mileage week ever (65 miles in 7 days).

[![dirtylegs](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dirtylegs_thumb.jpg "dirtylegs")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dirtylegs.jpg)I purposely wanted to run with sore / tired / empty legs. As well as my [mid week 19 miler](http://kapie.com/runblog/2011/07/long-run-home/), I ran to back to back 14 milers (Sat and Sun). These were great, my left were still suffering from my (too fast) mid week long run and after Saturday, walking up the stairs became a bit of a pain fest, so I was exactly where I wanted to be for my Sunday run.

Up and out the house by 7:15 on Sunday – really painful legs for the first 1/2 mile before I settled into my stride (shuffle). From then on in, it was more of a dull ache, until I finished at which point it went back to being hell on earth.

I carried on running on Monday (7 miles) and Tuesday (8 miles) just to keep up the pressure of running on tired legs and it went okay – again, painful to start with, but just a dull ache when I got into my stride.

After this I am pretty confident I can handle a multiday ultra, and I have my eye on the [Druids Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events_druidchallenge2011.htm) for later this year, but I also found a 50K ultra (okay, okay, I know 50K is barely an ultra – a baby ultra if you like – but it is still a LONG way !!) in the US in late Oct. It is the [Bimblers Bluff](http://mrbimble.com/WordPress/bluff/), in Connecticut on 23rd Oct – turns out I’m going to be in Boston over that weekend anyway, so I’m considering entering that also.

One more ‘testing’ session (two 19 milers back to back) and I’ll be ready to commit.
