This past weekend I did the longest run I’d ever done – 24 miles.

The mother-in-law had the kids for a sleep over on the Friday night, so, sacrificing a lie in with my lovely wife, I got up at 6:30, left the house at 7:15 and headed along the canal for my usual ~ 12 mile route to Theale, there I headed into the village, over the Pangbourne Road and up towards Bradfield where I joined my usual commute home for another 10 miles or so home – [all in 24 miles](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/49557095).

[![image](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_thumb.png "image")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image.png)I was a bit annoyed after the first 10 minutes or so, as it looked like the GPS on my phone wasn’t picking up the location, but it rectified itself after a bit and the 23.84 miles recorded is probably only .1 or .2 miles short.

I was pretty pleased with my fuelling / hydration – I had my Inov8 Race Elite rucksack with a drink bladder in it, which I had filled with 2L of “PSP22 Fuel” energy drink. I also carried 2 further sachets of this, as I knew there was water at Aldermaston (8 miles) and a shop at Bradfield Southend (15 miles) where I could get water.  
Before leaving home I ate a banana and had a glass of the PSP22 Fuel. I ate a fun size marathon bar and a 25g pack of yoghurt covered strawberry flakes at around 14 miles as well as topping up the bladder after 8 miles with just some water and then faffing around at 15 miles with 3 500ML waters I had bought trying to mix the powder. Next time I’ll take / try the gels instead, just with plain water. Apart from this faffing around the only negative thing was the bladder I’m using – the valve part and the stopper are just a pain, requiring me to twist the thing with my teeth and remove a stopper cap that then dribbles drink on me, which later turns into a sticky glue like substance…

The run itself was good, initially along the canal, about 3 miles along roads directly in the line of traffic and then some paths & pavements. I walked a few of the hills but ran pretty much all the way apart from those. I was listening to [Marathon Talk](http://www.marathontalk.com/) on my Phone / MP3 and I seemed to zone out for large parts of the run – I’ve been driving the latter half home tonight and just cannot remember large parts of the route at all.  
I finished around 11am, and felt pretty reasonable, previously when I’ve finish long runs (18+ miles), I’ve collapsed on the floor with aching legs – this time around I was fine, and just went about the rest of my day (after a ‘For Goodness Shake’, which I think are a real help – but cannot put my finger on why – maybe because I’m a gullible fool…)

Not yet sure I have my rehydration correct – I had hot and cold flushes on and off for the rest of the day, which is something I generally get at night after an evening long run. Also not sure it’s down to this run, but I felt flat and grumpy for the next few days.

In summary, excellent run, it’s given me good confidence for the [Bimblers Bluff 50K](http://mrbimble.com/WordPress/bluff/), need to try the same thing on gels and experiment a little with the rehydration afterwards.
