Over the bank holiday at the end of May, Richard Kell (a.k.a. [MidasMarathon](http://www.midasmarathon.com/index.html "MidasMarathon")) was running his ‘[Gavin and Stacey Marathon](http://midasmarathon.tumblr.com/post/6119716170/progress-update-gavin-stacey-completed "Gavin and Stacey Marathon")‘ – a 203.4 mile route from Billericay, Essex to Barry Island, Wales, over 4 days.

I joined him on day 2, for around 10 miles (from Didcot to Wantage). Richard is a great guy and has raised a ton of money for the ‘Help for Heroes’ charity throuigh his challenges / events – over £21,000 as of July 2011.

It was pretty inspirational chatting with him and listening to some of the things he’s done – really helped me focus on upping my mileage with a view to attempting an ‘ultra’.
