I’ve looked at what time I have available, how many runs I wanted to do, what distances etc. and tried to fit this around getting to work in the morning or home in the evening.

I also tried to get my long runs in during the week, so that I am not disappearing for the whole morning on a Saturday or Sunday.

I put together a decent plan and resolved to follow it as best I could, with a bit of room for flexibility.

This past week I have been in the US, so it has been a bit up and down. I got most of my runs / session in, just slipping by around 5 miles.

Here’s how the plan and the actual looked….
