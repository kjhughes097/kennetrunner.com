This is a great, local 16 mile cross country race, over undulating ground through beautiful countryside. The race is organised by [Overton Harriers](http://www.overtonharriers.org.uk/index.htm "Overton Harriers"), and starts at Combe Gibbet and finishes in the village of Overton.

It follows tracks most of the way, including sections of the ‘Wayfarers Way’, along ridges, through farm fields – beautiful – it crosses under a main road at one point (just past the 8 mile point) and there are a couple of short hilly sections around the 8 – 9 mile point also.

I love this race, it was my third running of it, having done it previously in [2004](http://www.overtonharriers.org.uk/races/combgibbet/2004/results.htm "2004 results") when I did 2:37:28 and [2005](http://www.overtonharriers.org.uk/races/combgibbet/2005/results.htm "2005 results") when I did 2:33:53 after starting around 15 late. This year ([2011](http://www.overtonharriers.org.uk/races/combgibbet/2011/cg2011res.xls "2011 results")) I finished in 2:27:01
