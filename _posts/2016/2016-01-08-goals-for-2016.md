I’ve been thinking about goals for 2016 recently. There’s a few specific things I want to accomplish :

### Complete the Thames Path 100

I DNF’d this race in [2013](https://kennetrunner.com/thames-path-100-race-report) and [again in 2015](https://kennetrunner.com/thames-path-100-2015-race-report), so I have unfinished business. Now that I have a [sub 24hr 100 miler under my belt](https://kennetrunner.com/?p=1004), and the confidence that I **can** finish, I’m hoping this is the year !!

### Set a new 100 mile PB

With a current PB of 23:34:08 (in my only 100 mile finish), I’m hoping I can knock a good chunk off that time (at the Thames Path 100)

### Set a new 50 mile PB

I set a new 50 mile PB last year as part [of the Autumn 100](https://kennetrunner.com/autumn-100-2015-race-report). I think I can better that in a straight 50 mile race (Thames Trot in Feb)

### Complete a Half Marathon in under 90 minutes

I’ve run a bunch of half marathons, and my [best so far is 94 odd minutes](https://www.strava.com/activities/47694780) – however that was a canal towpath run with a short wait for a swing bridge to close, and one of my first runs back after the Thames Path 2013 – so a bit of focused speed training should get me under 90 mins.

### Run at least 2016 miles in 2016

I managed 2014 in 2014, but failed pretty miserably in 2015 (only managing 1600 odd) due to lack of consistency. I’d like to get back to standard 40-50 mile weeks, week in week out.
