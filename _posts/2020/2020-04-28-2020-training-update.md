Well, it’s fair to say that 2020 has been a shit show so far. Most races cancelled due to the Covid / lockdown.

I was entered for the Thames Path 100 again, in May. However training had not really gone well, and it was looking more and more likely that it’d be either cancelled or postponed. So, I withdrew from that and entered the Autumn 100 instead.

Thames Path actually got postponed until September in the end. Currently the Autumn 100 is going ahead as planned in October.

Training has been spotty to say the least. It was so bad there are actually a few bike trainer session in there !!

Not the kind of mileage needed for a 100 miler, so withdrawing was the right decision.

Next up is the Centurion One virtual event. I’m going for a 100 mile training week. That will be a first for me. Hopefully splitting it down to multiple shorter runs, 2 or 3 per day, will make it manageable around work and family.
