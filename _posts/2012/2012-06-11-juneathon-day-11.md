Juneathon Day 11, Runstreak Day 103, and the day on which [King James III of Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_III_of_Scotland) died in 1488.

[![scottish-flag](scottish-flag_thumb.jpg "scottish-flag")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/scottish-flag.jpg)Still had a bit of DOMs from Saturdays effort, but todays run was a lunchtime 4 miler. No takers from the office to join me, I think the weather put most people off…

I was very conscious of the ache to start with, but quickly got into the zone, started day dreaming and before I knew it I was just about back to the office. I had expected something like 9 minute miles, but was surprised to see it come up as 8:16 pace.  

I had considered another 3 or 4 miles this evening, but getting kids off to bed etc took \*way\* longer than it should have, so in the end I was pleased to have got out at lunchtime, as the prospect of heading out late just didn’t appeal…

The other ‘event’ of the day was an email from [Centurion Running](http://www.centurionrunning.com/) about the 2013 Thames Path 100 – they were announcing that as a volunteer at this years event I could have a place for next year, before the public entries open on 6th July – so…. just signing off now to take them up on it – more on that tomorrow…
