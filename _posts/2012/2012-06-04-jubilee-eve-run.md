[![red-white-and-blue-bunting](red-white-and-blue-bunting_thumb.jpg "red-white-and-blue-bunting")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/red-white-and-blue-bunting.jpg)It’s been a weekend of celebrations, all over the country, for the Queens diamond jubilee. We’ve had a busy weekend so far, with a village fete / garden party yesterday and dinner with friends today. Yesterdays run was easily fitted in, getting up early and heading out for a long canal run, but today was a bit more difficult. I couldn’t get myself out of bed this morning before 9, meaning I would be running a ‘streaksaver’ (as [Mike Wells](https://twitter.com/#!/mikew30 "Mike Wells") likes to call them) this evening.

We got home around 7:30 and I headed out at 8. It was still very light, and I was considering heading out on my usual 5 mile out and back canal run, but at the last minute (at the bottom of the hill) I switched to a different route, that I hadn’t done in a while. I just fancied a change of scenery, so I headed up along the A4 then up to the top if Henwick hill, the back way, up past where we used to live. From there it’s over fields to Stoney Lane, into Ashmore Green and then back down the hill.

The sky was clear, the sun still bright but low and the views over the fields were incredible. It really was one of those runs when everything feels great – not especially fast, or long, or hard fought, just enjoyable running for the sake of running.
