[![Boeing777](Boeing777_thumb.jpg "Boeing777")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Boeing777.jpg)Juneathon Day 12, Runstreak Day 104, and on this day in 1994 the [Boeing 777](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777) aircraft made it first flight.

Really getting back into things today. A [speedy 5.5 miler at lunchtime](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/94584024) with a work colleague, felt good – averaged out at 8min/mile which wasn’t bad as the first mile or so was 9:30.

Other news of the day is that I entered the [Thames Path 100](http://www.centurionrunning.com/thames-path-100-2013/tp100-2013/) for 2013. The public entry doesn’t open till 6th July, but I got early access for volunteering to help out this year…

Just over 2 weeks to go till the [Endure24](http://www.endure24.co.uk/ "Endure24") event. I really need to start planning my approach – tent ?, do I take a sleeping bag (hopefully no sleeping will happen), food, clothing/kit etc.  
May well do a post on my plan, see what people think and solicit feedback / advice.
