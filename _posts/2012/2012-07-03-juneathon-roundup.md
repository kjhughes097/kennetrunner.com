Well it’s now July and Juneathon is over. Overall it went well – the plan was to

-   Run every day in June – CHECK
-   Blog about it every day in June – NO CHECK

Yes, although I kept up the runstreak all through June, and I almost made it blogging every day, I fell at the very last obstacle. I blogged every day up till 29th June and then missed it on the 30th.

To summarize the running side of things, here’s the metrics from runkeeper…

[![JuneathonActivities](JuneathonActivities_thumb.png "JuneathonActivities")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JuneathonActivities.png)Running was the easy part – at the start of June I was already 90 plus days into a runstreak, so it was just a case of sticking with it.

For some reason there wasn’t really a lot of long runs – couple of 15 milers was about it. It might have been tiredness from an 80 mile week I’d done just before this – but most stuff was around 4 or 5 miles and generally fast.

On the blogging side, I found it a lot tougher than I expected. After a full days work, and 1 or 2 runs, it was tough to open up the laptop and write about it, late on at night. I also felt like I didn’t have a lot to say – what’s interesting about ‘”oh I did another 5 miler along the Thames at lunchtime”. However I persevered and wrote every day till 30th.

To be honest I almost missed it on 29th as well, remembering late at night and having to make a last minute post from my phone. The 30th however was the first day of my 24 hour run and I had a lot on my mind that morning, so I’m not too surprised.

Overall, I am pretty pleased, the running was easy and the blogging, although I didn’t hit my target, I did get a lot of content onto the blog, I got into the habit of thinking about what to write about, what images to use, how to try and make it interesting (did it work ?).

I do think I’ll have another similar thing, sometime soon – hopefully something a bit more interesting than just what I’ve run that day – maybe something like every day for a week write about a different style of running (trail, marathon, ultra etc), or writing about a type of gear each day – who knows…

If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment…
