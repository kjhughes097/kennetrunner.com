Juneathon day 10, Runstreak day 102 and the day on which [Alexander the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") died (in 323BC).

It’s just after lunch on Sunday, and it looks as though I managed to salvage something of the week. Mileage so far is 36.6, and I might be able to get out for another 3 or 4 miles this evening to try and reach my weekly minimum target of 41m.

After [yesterdays speedy effort](https://kennetrunner.com/2012/8-miles-in-under-an-hour "yesterdays speedy effort"), my thighs were still aching today. Also, I didn’t get a decent nights sleep, so the 6:30 alarm was immediately switched off and ignored.  Mrs H nudged me at 8am and asked if I was planning on running, so I dragged myself out of bed and got my kit on and headed out the door, after taking the obligatory cup of tea up to Mrs H.

I had planned on 11 or 12 miles this morning, but the late start put paid to that – I only had till 9:30 and by now it was 8:20, so I decided on an easy effort on my usual 8 miler out and back along the canal.

Felt like I had heavy legs to start with but after a couple of miles I got into the zone and the miles passed quickly. If I start thinking about something (interesting) and planning then I find it easy to ‘zone out’ and before I know it a few miles have passed and I have no recollection of them – which really helps…

Anyway, 8.25 miles at 9 minute miles. Perfect temperature for running this morning and everyone else must have thought the same as  I passed a ton of other runners, cyclists and walkers. Really enjoyable running.
