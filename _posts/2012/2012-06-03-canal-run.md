This mornings run was a steady 11 mile effort along the Kennet and Avon Canal.

It felt a lot harder than it should have, but then again I have had a few hill and speed sessions recently, including a fast 5 miler late yesterday.

Weather wasn’t great – drizzling the whole way, but I try to simply ignore that. Wasn’t like a battle against wind and rain which changes the face of a run, just a minor inconvenience.

Normally I’ll see 8 or 10 other runners on a Sunday morning on this route, but not today, just 2 others spotted. Don’t know if that was down to it being the Jubilee weekend or the weather ?

This 11 miler takes me to a shade over 35 miles for the week – 6 miles below my minimum target, but it has been pretty hectic – spent the week in Boston, and also took a round trip to New Jersey, so a few of the runs were ‘streaksavers’ – just a couple of miles to make sure I got something in for the day, and didn’t break my runstreak. Today is #runstreak day 95, it is also Juneathon (#blogstreak) day 3.
