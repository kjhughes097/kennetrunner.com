Well, big milestone today, ***I have run every one of the last 100 days.***

This runstreak started as a plan to run every day in March, then got extended to 50 days, then extended again to 100 days. At this point I’m not yet ready to stop – next milestone will probably be 6 months.

I had not had a great week so far, with lots of taking things easy, 2 miles a day, so have been getting frustrated.

This morning was wet and windy, and not the most attractive for heading out along the canal, but I needed to get something longer done, and it was day 100 after all. Rain doesn’t generally bother me, in fact I often prefer the wet and windy days as the miles feel ‘hard fought’ and there is more of a sense of achievement / feeling alive. So, I zipped up my man suit and headed out for an early start. A steady 8 miles along the canal, the longest I’ve done this week, would bring me up to 20 miles and hopefully be able to salvage something near the minimum 40 miles I need for the week.

Lots of branches and trees down after last nights storm, but not quite as wet as I thought. It felt good, really good to get some miles under my belt. By the time I got to Aldermaston and onto the train my legs and shoes were caked with mud – I never seem to have a problem getting a seat to myself when I’m all sweaty and muddy, one of the benefits I guess…

Anyway, with any luck I can rescue this week with another 20 miles over the weekend – let’s see…
