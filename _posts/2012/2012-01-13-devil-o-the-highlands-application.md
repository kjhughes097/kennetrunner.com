[![highdev1](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highdev1_thumb.png "highdev1")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highdev1.png)This morning I posted my application for the 2012 [Devil o’ The Highlands Footrace](http://www.devilothehighlandsfootrace.co.uk/). It starts in [Tyndrum](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=tyndrum&hl=en&ll=56.437783,-4.712394&spn=0.003393,0.009645&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=14.880788,39.506836&vpsrc=6&hnear=Tyndrum,+Stirling,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=17) and covers the last 43 miles of the [West Highland Way](http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/theroute.asp), finishing in [Fort William](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=fort+william&hl=en&sll=56.437783,-4.712394&sspn=0.003393,0.009645&vpsrc=0&hnear=Fort+William,+Highland,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=14).

I grew up on the West of Scotland and spent many teenage weekends walking the hills around here, and over 20 years ‘munro bagging’. I’d never really considered doing (walking) the West highland Way, but have really got hooked on the idea of running it.

It’s around 95 miles miles end to end and they do [host a race every year](http://www.westhighlandwayrace.org/) in June, but I don’t think I’m up to that distance yet. Fortunately there are two other races that cover the distance in parts – this one ([The Devil o’ The Highlands](http://www.devilothehighlandsfootrace.co.uk/)) and the [Highland Fling](http://www.highlandflingrace.org/) which is at the end of April and covers the first 53 miles from Milngavie to Tyndrum.

The West highland Way race (full distance) is on my bucket list, and my (loose) plan is to do each of the (almost) half distance races to get a feel for the terrain and the level of training/endurance required and then do the full distance.

Anyway, here’s hoping I get a place on this one, this year.
