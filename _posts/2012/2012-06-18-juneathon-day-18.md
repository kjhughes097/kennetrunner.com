[![war1812](war1812_thumb.png "war1812")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/war1812.png)Juneathon Day 18, Runstreak day 110 and the anniversary  of the [War of 1812](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812) where the US Congress declared war on the United Kingdom.

Today was a recovery day after a big weekend. so a steady [4 miler at lunchtime with Chris and Saif](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95902399) from work was the plan.

This was done at around 8:30 pace. It actually felt a log harder than it should have – maybe it was the tired legs, maybe it was the heat.

After work, it was a visit to the sports massage clinic. This is not something I normally do, I’ve only ever had one massage before, years ago, but I thought I’d give it a try, see if I could my legs loosened up after all the training I have been doing recently.

It was pretty painful, and afterwards, my legs felt tired and ‘clean/flushed’ – I expect I’ll feel the real pain tomorrow, we’ll see. As for whether it did any good or not, I’m not yet sure – we’ll see how the next few days go…
