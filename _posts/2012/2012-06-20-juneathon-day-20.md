[![red_telephone](red_telephone_thumb.jpg "red_telephone")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/red_telephone.jpg)Juneathon day 20, Runstreak day 112 and the day in 1963 on which the red telephone creating the [Moscow to Washington ‘hotline’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow-Washington_hotline) was implemented. This was done after the events of the [Cuban Missile Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) made it clear that reliable, direct communications between the two nuclear powers was a necessity.

Today was a bit warm and ‘muggy’, but good conditions for running. I headed out for a lunchtime [5.5 mile loop](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/96423949?&mobile=false), and to start with, my legs still felt tired – maybe as a result of the massage on Monday, maybe just too many miles recently.  

I was thinking I’d go at around 8 minute miles, but started a little quicker than this (7:45) and found I was enjoying the feeling of speed, the 1.5 mile time/pace readout from [Runkeeper](http://www.runkeeper.com) told me I was just over 7:30s so I decided to crack on at that pace.

At around 4.5 miles the average pace was about 7:19 so I picked it up a bit to try an finish in a 7:15 average. I was blowing by this stage but kept up a decent pace and finished the 5.52 miles in 39:49 averaging 7:12 pace. Happy with that!!

I think I need a rest day (easy 2 miles)  to get prep’d for something longer at the weekend.
