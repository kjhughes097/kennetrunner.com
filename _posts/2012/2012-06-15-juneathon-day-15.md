[![football](football_thumb.jpg "football")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/football.jpg)Juneathon day 15, Runstreak day 107 and on this day in 1954, [UEFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) was formed – very topical as [England have just beaten Sweden 3-2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18181790) in their Euro 2012 match…

Today was an easy day, a very easy day. A short [2.7 mile canal run](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95291934) from home to the train station at noon.

I had been for a blood test first thing, then went along to the school (bring you Dad day) to spend the morning with Alastair – I remember my schooldays as being filled with playing with Lego, making biscuits and eating bacon sarnies (okay that last bit was just the Dads)…

Anyway, a short, easy day should set me up for a decent long effort tomorrow.. I hoping for at least 25 miles this weekend.

Stay tuned…
