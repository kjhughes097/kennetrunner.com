[![geronimo](geronimo_thumb.jpg "geronimo")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/geronimo.jpg)Juneathon Day 16, Runstreak day 108 and the day in 1829 on which [Geronimo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geronimo), the Apache leader was born.

According to Wikipedia, “Geronimo” means “one who yawns”, and that has definitely been me today !!

I was up reasonably early (for a weekend at least) this morning – about 6:45 – and headed out for a easy long run, [15 miles along the canal](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95456006). My plan for the weekend is back to back long effort. This will be the last big stress on my legs before the Endure24 in 2 weeks. Next weekend I’ll probably do a single long run.

Anyway, that early start and log effort had me yawning away, then I decided to double up today with another short effort while the kids were swimming, so I managed another [3.1 miles](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95566426) at 5pm.
