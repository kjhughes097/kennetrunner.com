[![JFKspeech](JFKspeech_thumb.png "JFKspeech")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/JFKspeech.png)Juneathon day 26, Runstreak day 118 and the day in [1963](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963) on which [U.S. President](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._President) [John F. Kennedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy) gave his “[Ich bin ein Berliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner)” speech.

A short update today – an [easy 4 miler with Anna at lunchtime](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/97728086) along the river Thames again. We kept it easy at 9:30 pace.

It was a bit ‘muggy’ today with no breeze, so I was pretty hot by the time we got back.

We also took a short detour today just to check out a little bit of the Thames Path that deviated from the towpath – bit it was only 100 metres or so and it joined back up with the towpath.
