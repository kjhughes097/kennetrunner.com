[![RunningGoal](RunningGoal_thumb.png "RunningGoal")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RunningGoal.png)I started my “run 2012 miles in 2012” goal a bit late (end of Feb), so have spent most of the first half of the year a bit behind and trying to catch up.

Well this weekend I caught up, after covering 75 miles in the Endure24 event. I am currently 40 miles ahead of plan, having now covered 1051 miles so far (to 2nd July, the 184th day of the year).

> **(2012/366) \* 184 = 1011.5 miles**

Feels good to have a bit of leeway now…
