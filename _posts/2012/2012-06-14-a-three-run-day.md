[![HawaiiFlag](HawaiiFlag_thumb.png "HawaiiFlag")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HawaiiFlag.png)Juneathon Day 14, Runstreak Day 106 and the day, in 1900, on which [Hawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii) became a United States territory.

I wanted to give myself some running on tired legs today. So after a [late 8.5 miler](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/94952254) last night, I got up at 6am and headed out for a [local 4 mile loop](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95023867). Legs were definitely still tired and felt a bit wobbly to start. I didn’t feel as though I was moving fast, but the pace turned out to be a steady 8:08/mile which I was pleased with.

Then at lunchtime I headed out with Chris for a [4 mile out and back effort](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95074239) along the River Thames. This was at a more leisurely 8:43 pace.

To finish things off I jumped on the train home, to Thatcham Station and then headed for my [2.6 miler home along the canal](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95154039) from the station. This was at an easy 8:53 pace as I had a slight niggle in my calf, up near the knee.

I also spent a bit of time today making a kit list for the [Endure 24](http://www.endure24.co.uk/ "Endure 24") at the end of the month. Jeez, the amount of stuff I’ll need is incredible – I could pack less for a 4 week holiday !!

Just about 29 miles for the week so far, which I’m happy with (I was at 12 miles this time last week). A couple of long efforts on the weekend should see me to 50+ for the week.
