[![apple-bite](apple-bite_thumb.jpg "apple-bite")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/apple-bite.jpg)Juneathon day 28, Runstreak day 120 and the day in 1997 on which [Mike Tyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson) was disqualified in the 3rd round of a boxing match for biting a piece off [Evander Holyfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield)‘s ear.

Sticking with the ‘bite’ theme, I’m continually trying to stave of worries of biting off more than I can chew for this [Endure24](http://www.endure24.co.uk) event. Of course there is no ‘distance’ to cover to finish or not finish, but I have given myself some targets and piled a little personal and public pressure / expectation on myself to meet them (70 miles minimum)

Today was also a continuation of the ‘hot and muggy’ theme from the past few days. 24-25 Celsius at [lunchtime, for our (very) slow 3 mile jog](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/98233446) – almost 10 min / mile pace, at the end of which I was drenched in sweat. No let up when we got back to the office as the shower only has one temperature (hot) and there is no air-con.

Thankfully the forecast is for it to get a little cooler tomorrow and over the weekend.
