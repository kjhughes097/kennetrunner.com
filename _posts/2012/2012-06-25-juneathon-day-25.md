[![The_Custer_Fight_(1903)](The_Custer_Fight_1903_thumb.jpg "The_Custer_Fight_(1903)")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The_Custer_Fight_1903.jpg)Juneathon day 25, Runstreak day 117 and the 136th anniversary of the [Battle of the Little Bighorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn) and the death of Lieutenant Colonel [George Armstrong Custer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer).

Straight into taper week – todays effort was an [easy 4 miler along the river Thames with work colleagues](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/97481840?&mobile=false). Nice easy 9:25 pace and I managed to hold myself back from speeding off. Need to keep that up for the rest of the week.

The plan is to do the same for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and then stay up late on Thursday night for a just past midnight short 2 miler on Friday morning, giving me a good 36 hours of recovery before the event on Saturday.
