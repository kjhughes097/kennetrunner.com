[![easy_as_123](easy_as_123_thumb.jpg "easy_as_123")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/easy_as_123.jpg)Well, it’s ‘juneathon’ day 6 and although I’ve been keeping it up (and the runstreak – day 98), it’s not going well.

We’re already at  end of play Wednesday already, and my weekly mileage total currently stands at a dismal 9.5 miles. It looks like this week is going to be a bit of a washout.

I’m still not feeling 100%, so thought I should take it easy again today – which meant a gentle 2 miles around the block. It was particularly tough keeping it short today, as I spent both commutes (to and from work) listening to [TalkUltra](http://www.marathontalk.com/archive/talk_ultra.php) – which is another great source of inspiration.

Anyway, with any luck I can get a couple of miles in tomorrow then something longer (8 – 12 miles) on Friday (which will be day 100 of the runstreak)  and then 20 over the weekend, taking me to my minimum weekly target of 40.

How do you cope when you don’t feel 100% ? cut things back or try to blast through it ?
