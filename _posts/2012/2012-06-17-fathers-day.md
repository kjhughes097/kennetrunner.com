[![fathersday](fathersday_thumb.jpg "fathersday")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fathersday.jpg)Juneathon day 17, Runstreak day 109 and [Fathers Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day) here in the UK.

After running a total of 18.6 miles yesterday to tire my legs out, I had planned an early morning 12 – 16 miler. It was not to be – falling asleep on the sofa in front of ‘Iron Sky’ last night, coupled with kids that were desperate to make me breakfast in bed for fathers day, put paid to my plan.

We had a nice ‘almost family’ day – Mrs H was poorly so sat out the events of the day and we kind of inherited a neighbours child for the day (Rubys BFF, so I’m told).

There was playing in the garden, a disco in Rubys room, lego building with Ali followed by an adventure/walk/picnic in the woods and then the dreaded homework just before a late dinner. By the time I had got them off to bed it was getting on for 8:30…

[I headed out on a 8 mile loop, but at the 2 – 3 mile point it was clear that it was probably a bit late to try and go round it twice, so I decided to extend it a little and do around 10 miles instead. I kept going, along the A4 to Cox’s Lane, which I something I did with a local running club years ago. A nice, long, steep effort up onto the ridge and into Upper Bucklebury (childhood home of Kate Middleton, future Queen of England) and then down Harts Hill to rejoin the regular loop after adding around 3 miles](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/95805844?&mobile=false).

All in, it was 10.75 mile, taking me to 60.91 miles for the week. Pleased with that …
