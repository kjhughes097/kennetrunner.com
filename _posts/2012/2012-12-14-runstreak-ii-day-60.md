Well, since my last update about breaking my (first) runstreak things have been going a bit better. I took 12 days off, no running at all and got over the injury â€“ it was feeling better after a week but i though Iâ€™d leave it longer to be 100% â€“ and â€“ this was the last time I would not be running every day so why not take advantage of it ðŸ™‚[![runstreak](runstreak_thumb.jpg "runstreak")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/runstreak.jpg)

I ran for a couple of days, took a days break and then started again in earnest on 16th October. Meaning today is day 60 of runstreak 2.

This time around, Iâ€™ve gone more for consistency than all out speed. I have done speed sessions but am trying to keep it to 1 (or 2 max) per week. I also got my 2012 miles in 2012 back on track with consistent 40 â€“ 50 mile weeks.

The other thing Iâ€™ve changed, and am quite enjoying is later runs â€“ getting home, having dinner, putting kids to bed then heading out for 6 â€“ 12 miles.

[![Strava_logo](Strava_logo_thumb.png "Strava_logo")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Strava_logo.png)Iâ€™ve also â€˜foundâ€™ [www.strava.com](http://www.strava.com) which is a run tracking app with a neat â€˜segmentsâ€™ feature, allowing you to challenge yourself against others on specific parts of your run â€“ hill sections or the likeâ€¦ I copied all my runkeeper data over to it and am now running them both in parallel, tracking with the runkeeper phone app and then downloading the GPX and posting that to strava. [![RK_logo_black](RK_logo_black_thumb.png "RK_logo_black")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RK_logo_black.png)Iâ€™m preferring the strava website but the runkeeper phone app is better for tracking whilst running. I should probably review and compare them in a separate post.

Final bit I changed is training plans â€“ no longer week to week based on feel, I put together a 16 plan â€“ specifically for getting me to the start line of the Thames Path 100 at the end of March 2013 â€“ be interesting to see how it works out for meâ€¦ Watch out for a post about that training planâ€¦
