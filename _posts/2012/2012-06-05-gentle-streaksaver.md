Todays run, in complete contrast to yesterdays, was not great. I had planned around 11 or 12 miles today, taking me to the high teens by Tuesday and setting me up well for a 50+ mile week.

A poor nights sleep, following by not getting out of bed till 10am put paid to anything long. I had also been feeling a little off colour most of the day, maybe a bug or something…

By the time I got round to getting ready to head out it was raining – a persistent drizzle really. I don’t mind rain at all, in fact I generally find that running in the rain makes me feel more alive than any other kind of run.

I thought I had better keep it easy, so decided on a gentle couple of miles. The route is pretty uninspiring, along the A4 for a bit, up pas the hospital and back along the local road – couple with the fact I wanted to go faster, and longer, but had to keep it easy, left me a bit frustrated.

I really need to get a decent 50+ mile week in this week, to make up for the 10 mile deficit from last week, an keep me on track for 2012 miles in 2012. Hoping the rest of the week is better…
