[![YukonFlag](YukonFlag_thumb.png "YukonFlag")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/YukonFlag.png)Juneathon day 13, runstreak day 105, and the day in 1898 on which the [Yukon Territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon) was formed. It is also T minus 17 until the [Endure24](http://www.endure24.co.uk) Run…

Todays effort was a [steady 8.5 miler](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/94952254?&mobile=false), this evening, at 8min/mile pace. Just a loop round the local streets, but also taking in a little track along a stream that I used to run along frequently, but haven’t for years – that was nice…

The other thing I have been doing today, has been starting to plan the logistics for the Endure24 – trying to work out whether to take a tent or not, what food / supplies I need and what clothing / kit.

I’m in a quandary about the tent thing, if I take one then it’s too easy to take a break / sleep if things get hard – so I probably shouldn’t…   BUT, if things do get bad and I have nowhere to go it’s going to pretty miserable – so I probably should…   Quandary!! Needs more thought…

Anyway, any advice, send it this way – much appreciated. I’ll probably do a specific post on my plan for this and then a follow up afterwards on how the plan worked out.
