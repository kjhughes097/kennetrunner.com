Last week (19 March – 25 March 2012) was my biggest ever running week.

I ran 11 times, covering 60.3 miles and burning 8259 calories. I think my previous  biggest week was around 48m, but generally my weeks have been around 30-40m so it was a pretty decent jump.

It was aided by 2 things, firstly I started a runstreak, so I was running at least once every day, and secondly I’ve been getting out at lunchtimes with work colleagues – normally about 3 or 4 miles.

Real sense of achievement with this, not just for the biggest distance, but the paces were pretty good, and, it gives me some confidence that I can cover an average of 40m week to reach my 2012m in 2012 goal – I have a bit of catching up to do as I didn’t get enough done in Jan and Feb, leaving me about 100m behind where I should be at the moment.
