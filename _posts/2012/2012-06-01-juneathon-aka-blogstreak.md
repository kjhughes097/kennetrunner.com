One of my twitter cohorts, [@mrafletch](https://twitter.com/#!/mrafletch), started his runstreak just over a year ago by doing a ‘Juneathon’ – deciding to run every day in June 2011 – and he hasn’t looked back since !!  
I was inspired [to do the same thing this past March](https://kennetrunner.com/2012/runstreak), run every day for the month. I also have not looked back (currently on day 93).

[Most people say](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/11/build-a-good-habit-in-30-days/) it takes [30 days to form a habit](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/), [there is even a website for it](http://www.30dayhabit.com/) – it certainly worked for Andrew and it seems to have worked for me, so it’s time for me to start another one – a blogstreak.

I want to blog abut my running every day in June 2012 – it’s an experiment really, no so much the ‘can I do’ aspect but more on the will I be able to keep it interesting on a daily basis – the answer right now is, I don’t know…

Anyway, I plan to start it – if it works then great, if it works and becomes a habit that I continue, even better. If it doesn’t work then I haven’t really lost anything other than a bit of my time writing about something I love doing.

Feel free to add comments with feedback – what works, what doesn’t, what’s interesting, what’s not.
