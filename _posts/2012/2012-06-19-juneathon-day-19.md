[![KuwaitFlag](KuwaitFlag_thumb.png "KuwaitFlag")](https://kennetrunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/KuwaitFlag.png)Juneathon day 19, Runstreak day 111 and the in 1961 on which [Kuwait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait) gained its independence from the UK.

I had an unsettled night after my sports massage, waking up a few times with a real dull ache in my quads. To be honest I was kind of expecting this – doesn’t make it any better though.

On waking, I could still feel the ache and my legs still felt very tired, but after a couple of hours I had forgotten about it, and/or it was less noticeable.

Come lunch time I thought I’d go and see how it went – if it was tough going I’d settle for 3 miles, if it felt okay I might push on to 5.5 miles. I guess I had kind of settled on 4 miles in my mind.  

Once I got into it, I could really feel the tiredness in my legs – more than I had left just before heading out – but I let my mind wander and [pushed on to do the full 5.5 miles](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/96163901) at 8:09 pace (it was actually 8 min pace, but I stopped at the petrol station to pick up a sandwich.

Legs still don’t feel quite right, but I was thinking it would be a couple of days – so hoping an early night will help and I’ll feel fresh in the morning. We’ll see…
