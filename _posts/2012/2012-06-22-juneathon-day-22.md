Anyway, todays run was a [short recovery run – 8 min / mile pace](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/96913190), which felt very slow (I still find it hard to believe that I can say that now – the runstreak has really driven my speed on). I was home early, so nipped out just before dinner. I had considered a 4 or 5 miler but thought something short, a nice easy day, would serve me better – I am supposed to be tapering after all !!
