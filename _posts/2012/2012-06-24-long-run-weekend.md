The longest day run was a new event this year, with the aim of having people all over the world run as many miles as they could between midday on Saturday 23rd June and midday on Sunday 24th June.

I have been following the amazing efforts of a few people on Twitter (particularly [@mrafletch](http://twitter.com/mrafletch) and [@mikew30](http://twitter.com/mikew30)) with the #ldrun hasthtag.  

Unfortunately I didn’t do any miles for it. I didn’t want to get caught up in the event and do too many miles, as I was planning my last long run on Saturday followed by a taper. I also had a busy ‘family’ weekend planned. So my long run yesterday was in the morning (before the longest day run started) and my easy / recovery run today was around 7pm, so after the event had ended.

Also on this weekend was the [Western States 100](http://ws100.com) (which saw the men’s and ladies course records go Timothy Olson in 14:46:44 and Ellie Greenwood in 16:47:19) and the [West Highland Way Race](http://www.westhighlandwayrace.org/) (won by Terry Conway in a new course record of 15:39:15 with Rosie Bell as the first lady in 20:15:41)

I’m getting a bit excited after reading all the updates, and starting to plan next weekend in earnest, so it was a little hard to keep to the plan for tonight’s run – [an easy 3.8 miler round the local roads](http://runkeeper.com/user/kjhughes/activity/97367885?&mobile=false). It definitely felt like I was taking it easy, but the 8:15 pace was faster than I had planned (around 9 min pace).
